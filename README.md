<h1>DNSStatus</h1>
<p>DNSStatus is a little script wrote in Python3.5 for checking an remote host IP address and sending a mail to a coresponding email-address.</p>

<p>Replace the following:</p>
<p><strong>SMTP_USERNAME</strong> = email address used for SMTP logon<br /><strong>SMTP_PASSWORD</strong> = password for SMTP logon<br /><strong>SMTP_SERVER</strong> = IP/DNS of the SMTP server<br /><strong>SMTP_PORT</strong> = PORT for SMTP server<br /><strong>SMTP_DESTINATION_ADDRESS</strong> = destination email address</p>
